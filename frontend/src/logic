When the display button is clicked the Add component otggles invisible and the Display component toggles visible

So too the delete component becomes visble / or and the edit button component.

I think they want seperate components for each one so the dislpay would have different components in div frames.


The Problem:

The Display button should open localhost3000/api and the data.json component should display the different projects inculding the new entry.
At the moment it is not opening the localhost3000/api it has the error cannot get file and is the localhost3000.

The Display button is visible which is fine (I used hooks for that function) and dissapears when I click it, the page should then open with the result of the projects, which is the display.js page, the add.js page should then be toggled invisible. The 
delete component or remove button should have it's own DIV frame with the edit button on the display.js page which would open the edit component or PUT request page...this page would be the same as the ADD.js page which is the first page or compoenent but with the PUT request rather than the POST, this request
 would naturally edit the fields and update that which needs to change.

 At the moment only the id updates but the app adds a number to the json file id: 4, id: 5, but the form is not recorded into the json file.

 I would like help to create the CRUD app so that the json file updates from the react crud form application.

 Thanks in advance I will send the code if you need to look at it, also how would I install a 'chalk' heading with node, I'm struggling with that...
